#### Normative Appendix A Multiple-Zone Systems

This appendix pressent an alternative procedure for calculating teh
sustem ventilation efficiency ($E_v$) that must be used when Table

A1. System Ventilation Efficnecy.


For any multiple-zone recirculation system, the system ventilation
efficneincy ($E_v$) shall be calculated in accordance with Sections A1.1
through A1.3.




A1.1. Average Outdoor Air Fraction ($X_s4) for ventilation system shal

$X_s = \dfrac{V_out} {V_ps}$

where uncorrected outdoor air intake ($V_ou$) is found in accordance
with Section 6.2.5.3 and the system primary air flow ($V_ps$) is found
at the condition analyzed.


A1.2.2 Secondary Recirculation Systems.

For secondary recirculation systems wherein all or part of the supply
air to each ventiation zone is recirculated air (which has not been
directly mixed with outdoor air) from other zones, zone ventilation
efficiency ($E_vz$) shall be determined in accordance with Equation
A1.2.2-1.

$E_vz = (F_a + X_s \times F_b _ Z_pz \times E_p \times F_c) / F_a$

where system air fraction



$$F_a = E_p + (1- E_p) \times E_e
F_b = E_p
F_c = 1 - (1 - E_z)) \times (1 - Ee) \times (1 - E_p)$$






Mass balance for steady stae air flow of $CO_2$

$V_0 = N/(C_s - C_0)$

where


$V_0$ - outdoor airflow rate per person

$V_e$ - breathing rate

B - $CO_2$ generation rate per person

$C_e$ - $CO_2$ concentratoin in exhales breath

$C_s$ - $CO_2$ concentration in the space

$C_o$ - $CO_2$ concentration in outdoor air.




The oxygen consumption rate is 0.0127 cfr, (0.36 L/min) when the
activity level is 1.2 met.


Informative Appendix D -- mass balance equation for use with the iaq
procedure.

Variable-Air-Volume(VAV) single-zone systems reduce the circulation rate
when the thermal load is lower than the design load. This is accounted
for by a flow reduction fraction ($F_r$)

A masws balance equation for the contaminant-of-concern may be written
and used to determine teh required outdoor airflow or the breathing zone
contaminant concentration for the various system arrangements.


Separation distance (L) shall be determined using any of the followign
approaches:

a. Use of values of L in Table F2-1.
b. Calculate L in accordance with Equation F2-1 or F2-2.
c. Determine L using any calculation or test procedure approved by the
authority having jurisdiction that shows that the proposed design will
result in equivalent or great distribution factor that those specifed in
Table F2-2


$L = 0.09 \cdot \sqrt{Q} \cdot(\sqft{DF} - U/400)$
$L = 0.04 \cdot \sqrt{Q}
