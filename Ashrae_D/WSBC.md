# Wall/Surface Boundary Conditions 

### Summary 
----
Surface temperature and heat transfer are often complicated by variables of time and position

Within the equations, conduction and radiation from walls and ambient air will need to be accounted for.

Set the boundaries with initial conditions and with a thermal conductivity coefficient and find the equations that you would want to use for the radiative portion.
