# Thermodynamics and refrigeration cycles 
#ASHRAE 

[[ASHRAE - Objective 1]]
Potential energy within a stored energy system is typically caused by attractive forces existing between molecules, or the elevation of the system 

$$PE = mgz$$
m = mass
g = local acceleration of gravity
z = elevation above horizontal reference plane

#Law
First law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy, where the amount of energy within the system must stay within the system.

Reference ([Gibbs free energy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy))

#Law 
The second law of thermodynamics can be describe in terms of entropy 
#equations 
$$ E_i - E_o = dS_system$$

Understanding the coefficient of performance is also important, refrigeration cycles tend to drain the most energy in terms of utilities.

Carnot cycle is completely reversible. This will never be the case with many cycles within the realm of thermodynamics.
