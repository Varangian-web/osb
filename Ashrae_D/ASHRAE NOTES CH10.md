# Indoor environmental health
----

## Intro 

Comprises aspects of human health and disease that are determined by factors  in the indoor environment. This section provides general background information and introduces important concepts of hazard recognition, analysis, and control. In turn, it addresses information on specific hazards, and describes sources of exposure to each hazard, potential health effects, relevant exposure standards and methods to control exposure. 

### Microbiology 
___

It is important to limit unnecessary moisture within buildings on various surfaces. This gives microorganisms the chance to support life, reproduce and evolve. Bacterial colonies can affect humans with disease and grow within the host, eventually attempting to become infectious to other humans.

### Hazard Control 
----
#LEV
Local exhaust ventilation is more effective for controlling point-source contaminates than is general dilution ventilation. Using high velocity air movement captured the particles and removes them from the work environment. This strategy is most frequently used where particles are generated either in large volumes or high velocities 

## Airborne Contaminants 
----

Can include biological and non-biological particles, bio-aerosols, chemical gases and vapors. These contaminants can be either sourced from within the building or from the outside 

**Units of Measure** : The quantity of particles in the air if frequently reported as the mass concentration or count concentration in a given volume of air. *Fine particulate matter* is consider to be any particles that are less the 2.5x10^-6 in diameter.



$$
Concentration= mg/m^3
Concentration= PPM
$$

# Gaseous contaminants 
-----

Volatile organic compounds include 4 to 16 carbon structures. Many instances have been phased out such as refrigerants. Like [these](https://elgracool.pl/List-of-HFC-refrigerants-cterms-eng-90.html) which are either illegal or being phase out.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration set permissible exposure limits for toxic hazardous substances. [OSHA PELs](https://www.osha.gov/annotated-pels/table-z-1)
