# Fenestration 

## Intro
----
Fenestration is an architectural term that refers to the arrangement, proportion, and design of window, skylight and door systems within a buidling 

## Component 

### Glazing Units

### Framing 

These materials are typically
- wood 
- metal 
- polymers

# Determining fenestration energy flow 
![[Pasted image 20210721091555.png]]

Energy flows with fenestration via conductive and convective heat transfer caused by temperature differences with outdoor and indoor air 
#important 
#equations 

$$
Q =U A_{pf}(t_{out}-t_{in})+(SHGC)A_{pf}E_t+C(AL)A_{pf}\rho C_pt_{out}-t_{in}
$$

It is notable to mention that solar heat gain coefficients depond on solar incident angle and spectral distributions. The values of U and SHGC can cause some error in calculating Q, with the larger percent error stemming from SHGC

# U-Factor(Thermal Transmittance )

This section will need to be examine further if the glazing of buildings is of high importance. Might be beneficial to dictate window as a thermal source. There are various table to describe the behavior of glazing and fenestration among various #conditions 

### condensation resistance

CRF = \frac {(t-t_c)}{t_h-t_c}
