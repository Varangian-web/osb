# Odors 
## Intro 
---
Various factors make odor control an important consideration in ventilation engineering: (1) contemporary construction methods result in buildings that allow less air infiltration through the building envelope; (2) indoor sources of odors associated with modern building materials, furnishings, and office equipment have increased; (3) outdoor air is often polluted; and (4) energy costs encourage lower ventilation rates at a time when requirements for a relatively odor-free environment are greater than ever.

Olfactory sensitivity often makes it possible to detect potentially harmful substances at concentrations below dangerous levels so that they can be eliminated. Foul-smelling air is often assumed to be unhealthy. In reality, however, there is little correlation between odor perception and toxicity, and there is considerable individual variation in the perception of pleasantness/unpleasantness of odors.

Pyschophical Power #Law. This is the realtion between perceived odor magnitude S and conenctration C, which conforms to a power function 

$$
S = kC^n

This exemplifies the psychophysical power law, also called Stevens' #Law  Where in the olfactory ream, n < 1
