# Fluid Flow 

In Newtonian fluids,  the rate of deformation is directly proportional to the shearing stress
In non-Newtonian fluids, the relationship between the rate of formation and shear stress is much much much more complicated.
#equations 
$$ mdot = pVA$$
Where:
mdot = mass flow rate 
p = density 
V = average velocity 
A = area of the pipe or duct that the flow is traveling 

Bernoulli equation is a fundamental principle of fluid flow analysis. It incorporates the conservation of momentum and energy along a streamline 

Turbulence is involving random perturbations or fluctuations of the velocity and pressure, characterized 

Reynolds number is dimensionless relative ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces
