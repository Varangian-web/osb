# SPACE AIR DIFFUSION
## Intro
--- 
Room air distribution systems are intended to provide thermal comfort and ventilation for occupants 

The diffusion methods can be classified as one of the following:

**Mixed systems:** Overhead air distribution with little or no thermal stratification of air within the space.

**Fully(thermally) stratified systems:** Thermal displacement ventilation that produces little or no mixing of air within the occupied space 

**Partially mixed systems:** Underfloor air distribution designs are examples of this type of system 

**Task/ambient conditioning systems**: Focus on conditioning only a certain portion of the space for thermal comfort and/or control.


## Summary 

This chapter described various air diffusion methods and how they interact with the control volume. Mostly descriptions of them such as "linear bar diffusers"
which are ventilation that is fed from the floor. Many of the instances in this chapter were irrelevant but can be referenced in some cases.
