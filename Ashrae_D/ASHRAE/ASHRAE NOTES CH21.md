# Duct Design 

## Intro 
---

Deficiencies in duct design can result in systems that operate incorrectly or are expensive to own and operate. Poor design or lack of system sealing can produce inadequate airflow rates at the terminals, leading to discomfort, loss of productivity, and even adverse health effects. Lack of sound attenuation may lead to objectionable noise levels. Proper duct insulation eliminates excessive heat gain or loss.

$$
\frac {v^2}{2g_c}+ \int \frac {dP}{\rho} = constant
$$

$$
\Delta p_{t,1-2}=(p_{s,1}+ \frac {rho V^2_1}{2})+(p_{s,2}+ \frac {rho V^2_2}{2})+g(\rho_a-p)(z_2-z_1)
$$

### Head and Pressure 
The head is the height of a fluid column supported by fluid flow, whereas pressure is the normal force per unit area

### Pressure changes in system

For all constant-area sections, total and static pressure losses are equal.
At diverging transitions, velocity pressure decreases, absolute total pressure decrease, and absolute static pressure can increase. This phenomena is know as static regain.

## Fluid Resistance 
### Friction Losses 

Friction losses are due to fluid viscosity and result from momentum exchange between moelcules (in lmainar flow) or between in-dividual particles of adjacent fluid layers moving at different velocities (in turbulent flow). Friction losses occur along the entire duct length.
