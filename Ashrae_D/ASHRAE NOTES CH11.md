# Air contaminants

## Intro

The particulate class covers a vast range of particle sizes, from dust large enough to be visible to the eye to submicroscopic particles that elude most filters. Particles may be liquid, solid, or have a solid core surrounded by liquid. The following traditional particulate contaminant classifications arise in various situations, and overlap.

• Dusts, fumes, and smokes are mostly solid particulate matter, although smoke often contains liquid particles. 

• Mists, fogs, and smogs are mostly suspended liquid particles smaller than those in dusts, fumes, and smokes. 

• Bioaerosols include primarily intact and fragmentary viruses, bacteria, fungal spores, and plant and animal allergens; their primary effect is related to their biological origin. Common indoor particulate allergens (dust mite allergen, cat dander, house dust, etc.) and endotoxins are included in the bioaerosol class. 

• Particulate contaminants may be defined by their size, such as coarse, fine, or ultrafine; visible or invisible; or macroscopic, microscopic, or submicroscopic. 

• Particles may be described using terms that relate to their interaction with the human respiratory system, such as inhalable and respirable

• Gases, which are naturally gaseous under ambient indoor or outdoor conditions (i.e., their boiling point is less than ambient temperature at ambient pressure) 

• Vapors, which are normally solid or liquid under ambient indoor or outdoor conditions (i.e., their boiling point is greater than ambient temperature at ambient pressure), but which evaporate readily

Harmful effects of noviable particles on people include toxicity, irritation and odor. It is known that larger coarse and fine particles trapped before reaching the lungs are likely to cause irritation if present in sufficient quantity.

### Units of measurement 

The quality of particulate matter in the air can be determined as a mass or particle count in a given volume of air.

Suitable methods for determining the quantity of particulate matter in the air vary, depending on the amount present and on the size of particles involved.

**Direct gravimetric measurement**: a dusty air sample is drawn through a pre-weighed filter. If the total airstream is drawn through the test filter, the sample is know as the total mass.

**Optical particle counters **:  Individual aerosol particles are illuminated with a bright light as they singly pass through OPC viewing volume

**Condensation nucleus counter **: Possesses the capability to count particles below 0.01 micrometer. Cannot directly provide the particle sizing information but can provide the total number of particles.

Controlling Exposures to Particulate Matter Include:
- Reduction of source emissions 
- Capture of emissions at the source using local exhaust
-  Dilution using mechanical ventilation 
-  Removal from ventilation air by filtration 

### Volatile organic compounds 

**Volatile organic compounds (VOCs):** are organic chemical compounds whose composition makes it possible for them to evaporate under normal indoor atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure.

Sources of VOCs include solvents, reagents, and degreasers in industrial environments and various other manufacturing environments

**Semivolatile organic compounds(SVOCs)**: have higher boiling points that typical VOCs and lower vapor pressures. This means that they are present in lower concentrations and tend to outgas more slowly and condense more readily, sticking to various things such as floors, furniture and clothing and remain in the surroundings for longer periods of time.

### Industrial Air Contaminants 

The three main methods of control for inorganic gaseous contaminates are source control, ventilation control and removal by filters.

Symptons of exposure to indoor polluants include coughing, sneezing, eye, throat, and skin irriation, nausea, etc....
#example This seems to happen within the galaxy building because of FPL etch.
The contaminants within the air cause irritation of the eyes and coughing. Many individuals on the floor constantly wear masks both because of covid-19 and the air contaminants.

#important 
Dilution ventilation is much less effective than local exhaust for reducing contamination from point-source emissions, and is used for control only when sources are distributed and not amenable to capture by an exhaust hood 

Ventilation systems may be a source of VOCs
