### Hood Static Pressure

The values for hood entry loss coefficient ($h_e$) for variouh hoon
shapes are listed under Chapter 5. When hood static pressure is known,
the volumetric flow rate can be determined by the following:

$Q = 1096 \sqrt{SPM} {(1 + h_e) \rho$


where:

Q - volumetric flow rate, cfm
A - area of duct attached to hood, $ft^2$
$SP_h$ - U-tube average manometer reading, "wgg

simplification >>

$Q = 4005 A C_e \sqrt{SP_h}$


Pressur readings as the square of the velocity or volumetrim flow rate.
A marked reduction in hood static pressure often can be traced to one or
more of the following conditions:

1. Reduced performance of the exhaust fan caused by reduced shaft speed
   due to belt slippage, wear, or accumulation on rotor or casing that
   would obstruct air flow.
   
2. Reduced performance caused by defects in the exhaust piping such as
   an accumulation in branch or main ducts due to insufficient
   conveying, condensation of oil or water vapors on  duct walls,
   adhesive characteristics of material exhausted, or leakage losses
   caused by loose clean-out doors, broken joints, holes worn in
   duct(most frequently in elbows), poor connection to exhauster inlet,
   accumulations in ducts or of fan blades.
   
   
3. Reduced air flow rate also can be charged to additional exhaust dct
   openingns dded to the system (sometimes system are designed for
   future commections and more ari than required is handled by present
   branches until future connections are made) or change of setting of
   branch lines. Blast gates adjust theair distribution between the
   various branches. Tampering with the blast gates can seriously
   affecet such distribution and therefore they should be locked in
   plcace immediately after the system has been installed and its
   effectiveness verified. Fan volume control dampers also should be
   checked.
   
4. Reduced volumetric flow may be caused by increased pressur loss
   through the dust collector due to lack of maintenance, improper
   operation, wear, etc. These effects will vary with the collector
   design. Refer to operation and maintenance instructions furnished
   with the collector or consult the equipment manufacturer.
   
### Velocity pressure.


The velocity pressure can be used to compute the velocity of the air
stream if the density of the air is known.

$V = 1096 \sqrt{\dfac{VP}{\rho}}$

where: 

VP - velocity pressure, "wg
$\rho$ - actual gas density, $lb/m/ft^3$

where air is at standard conditions >>

$V = 4005 \sqrt{VP}$

VP vs velocity can be referenced under Chaper 5 tables 5-7A and 5-7B.

$VP_e = \dfrac{VP_m}{df}$

where: 

$VP_e$ - equivalent velocity pressure "wg
$VP_m$ - measured velocity pressur, "wg
df - desity factor coefficient


Correction for changes in elevation, duct pressure, and temperatue cane
be made independently of each other with reasonable accuracy. The
individual correction coefficients are multiplied together to determine
the change from standard air density.

$\rho = 0.075 df$ and
$df = CF_e CF_p CF_t$

where:

$CF_e$ - correction for elevation outside the range of $\pm$ 1000 ft
$CF_p$ - cottection for local duct pressure greater than $\pm$ 20 wg
$CF_t$ - correction for temperatures outside range of 40 to 100 F

An exception is when elevation significantly different from sea level
arou coupled with high moisture content.

The correction coefficient for elevation $CF_e$ is given as:

$CF_e =[1 - (6.73 \times 10^-6)(z)]^5.258$

where:

z - elevation, ft

CF for local duct pressure is:

$CF_p = \dfac{407 + SP}{407}$

where:

SP = static pressure "wg

The correction coefficient for temperatuer, $CF_t$, is :

$CF_t = \dfrac{530} {t + 460}$

where:

t - dry-bulb tempretature.


density factor for diffeternt altitueds, barometric pressures, and
temperatures conditions is shown in Table 9-8


The following procedure may be used on systems that were desinged to
balance without the aid of blast gates. It does not detect poor choices
of design criteria such as low conveying or capture velocities, and will
not revel inadequate cotrol due to this type of error.

1. Determine volumetric flow in duct with a pitot traverse. If
   volumetric flow matches design; go to step 4; otherwise continue with
   1a
	
	a. Check fan size against plan;
	b. Check fan speed and direction of rotation against design;
	c. Check fan inlet and outlet configuration against plan;
	
	
2. If a discrepancy is found and corrected, return to Step 1. If not,
   measure fan inlet and outlet static pressures and compute the fan
   static pressure. Using fan table, check flow, fan static pressure and
   fan speed. If agreement is acceptable although at some other
   operating point than specified, fan is satisfactory, and trouble
   elsewhere.
   
3. If fan inlet static pressure is greater (more negative) than
   calculated in the design, proceed to Step 4. If tan outlet static
   pressure is greater (more positive) than design, proceed to Step 8.
   
4. Measure hood static pressure and check against desingn. If correct,
   go to Step 10; otherwise, continue to step 4a
   
   a. Check size and design of hoods and slots against
	b. Examine each hood for obstructions.
	
5. After all hood construction errors and obstructions have been
   corrected, if hood static pressures are correct, return to Step 1; if
   too low, proceed to Step 6.
   
6. Measure static pressure at various junctions in ducts and compare
   witwh design calculations. If too high at a junction, proceed
   upstream until statim pressure are too low and isolate the trouble.
   In an area where the loss exceeds design:
   
   a. Check angle of entries to junctions against plan;
   b. Check radii of elbows against plan;
   c. Check duct diameter against plan;
   d. Check duct for obstructions
   
   If the static pressure is too low, proceed downstream and locate the
   trouble.
   
7. After correcting all construction details which deviate from
   specifications, return to Step 1.
   
8. Measure pressur differentaial across air cleaning device and check
   against manufacturer's data. If loss is excessive, make neccessary
   corrections and return to Step 1. It loss is less than anticipated,
   proceed to Step 8a
   
   a. Check ducts, elbows, and entries as in Step 6a and 6d.
   b.Check system discharge type and dimensions against plans.Check
   system discharge type and dimensions against plans.Check system
   discharge type and dimensions against plans.Check system discharge
   type and dimensions against plans.
   
9. If errors are found, correct, and return to Step 1. If no errors can
   be detected, recheck design against plan, recalculate, and return to
   Step 1 with new expected design parameters.
   
10. Measure control velocities at all hoods where possible. If control
	is inadequate, redesign, or modify hood.
	
11. The above process should be repeated until all defects are corrected
	and hood static pressures and control velocities are in reasonable
	agreement with design. The actual hood static pressures should then
	be recorded for use in periodic system checks. A file should be
	prepared containing the following docements: 
	
	- System plan 
  
   - Design calculations
   - Fan rating table
   - Hood static pressures after field measurement
   - Maintenance schedule
   - Periodic hood static pressure measurement log
   - Periodic maintenance log
