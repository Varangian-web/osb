### Typical Air Conditoning Processes


#### Moist Air Sensible Heating or Cooling


$q_2 = \dot{m_{da}} (h_2 - h_1)$

steady state rate of heating.


#### Moist Air Cooling and Dehimidification.

material balance with steady-flow of energy:


$\dot{m_da} h_1 = \dot{m_da} h_2 + q_2 + \dot{m_w} h_{w2}$

$\dot{m_w} = \dot{m_{da}}(W_1 - W_2)$
$_1q_2 = \dot{m_{da}}[(h_1 - h_2) - (W_1 - W_l) h_{w2}]$


#### Adiabatic Mixing of Two Moist Airstreams

$\dot{m_da1}h_1 + \dot{m_da2}h_2  = \dot{m_da3}h_3$
$\dot{m_{da1} + \dot{m_{da2} = \dot{m_{da3}}$
\dot{m_{da1}W_1 + \dot{m_da2}W_2 = \dot{m_{da3}}W_3

Eliminating \dot{m_{da3}}

$$\dfrac{h_2 - h_3}{h_3 - h_1} = \dfrac{W_2 - W_3}{W_3 - W_1} = \dfrac{
\dot{m_{da1}} {\dot{m_{da2}}}} $$


### Adiabatic Mixing of Water Injected into Moist Air

$\dot{m_{da}}h_1 + \dot{m_w}h_w = \dot{m_da}h_l$
$\dot{m_da}W_1 + \dot{m_w} = \dot{m_da}W_2$


therefore,

\dfrac{h_2 - h_1}{W_2 - W_1} = \dfrac{\Delta h} {\Delta W} = h_W


#### Space Heat Absorption and Moist Air Gains

Air conditioning required for a space is usually determined by

(1) the quantity of moist air to be supplied
(2) the supply air condition necessary to remove given amounts of energy
and water from the space at the exhaust condition specified.


Assuming steady state conditions, governinng equations are

$\dot{m_{da}} h_1 + q_s + \sum(\dot{m_w}h_w) = \dot{m_{da}}h_2$
$\dot{m_{da}}W_1 + \sum \dot{m_w} = \dot{m_{da}W_2$

or
$$q_s + \sum(\dot{m_w} h_w) = \dot{m_da}(h_2 - h_1)$$

$ \sum \dot{m_w} = \dot{m_{da}} (W_1 - W_2)$



### Thermodymamics and Refrigeration Cycle




Potential energy

$$PE = mgz$$


KE = mV^2 /2



$$\sum_{all_streams_entering} \dot{m}(h + \dfrac{V^2}{2} + gz) - 
\sum_{all_streams_leaving} \dot{m}(h + \dfrac{V^2}{2} + gz) + \dot{Q} -
\dot{W} = 0$$

where h = u + pv



$Q - W = [m(u_f - u_t)]_{system}


### Second Law of Thermodymatica

dS_{system} = \dfrac{\partial Q}{T} + \partial m_i s_i - \partial m_e
s_e + dI$

where

$dS_{system}$ - total change within system in time dt durng process
$\partial m_i s_i$ - entropy increase caused by mass entering(incoming)
$\partial m_e s_e$ - entropy decrease caused by mass leaving (exiting)
$\partial Q / T$ - entropy change caused by reversible heat transfer
between system and surroundings at temperature T
$

$$\partial Q = T[(\partial m_e s_e) + d S_{sys} - dI]$$
o


In integrated form, if inlet and outlet properties, mass flow, and
interactions with the surroundings do not vary with time, the general
equation for the second law is

$$(S_f - S_i)_{system} = \int_rev \dfrac {\partial Q}{T} + \sum
(ms)_{in} - \sum(ms)_{out} + I


The irreversiblerate,which is the rate of entropy production caused by
irreversibilities in the process, can be determined by rearranging
previous equation;

$\dot{I} = \sum(\dot{m}s)_{out} - \sum(\dot{m} s)_{in} - \sum
\dfrac{\dot{Q}} {T_{surr}}


equation can be used to replace the heat transfer.

$$\dot{I} = \dot{m}[(s_out - s_in) - \dfrac{h_out - h_in}{T_{surr}}]$$




# Calculating Thermodynamic Properties

At least two intesive propertien must be known to determine the
remaining. Entropy cay be considered a function of T and pi

$$ ds = (\dfrac{\partial s}{\partial T})_p dT + (\dfrac{\partial
h}{\partial p)_T dp
