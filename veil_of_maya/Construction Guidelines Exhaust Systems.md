### Construction Guidelines

[[Exhaust System Design Procedure]]


Exhaust systesms should be construct with materials suitable for the  condition of service and installed in a permanent and workman-like manner. To minimize friction loss and turbulence, the itnerior of all ducts should be smooth and free from obstructioncs - escpeically at joints.

##### Construction Classification

Class 1 - Light Duty:  non-abrasive applications (e.g. replacement airm, general ventilation, gaseous emissions)

Class 2- Medium Duty: applications with moderately abrasive particles(e.g. buffing, polishing, grain dust)

Class 3 - Heavy Duty: application with high abrasive in low concentrations (e.g. abrasive blasting, cleaning operations, dryers, boiler breeches)

Class 4 - Extra Heavy Duty: application of highly abrasive particles in high concentrations.

Spiral ducting should not be used for Class 3 and Class 4 abrasives.

- Unless flanges are used for joints, the duct should be suppoorted close to each joint, usually within 2 inches.
- Joints hsould be sealed by methods show to be adequate for the service
- Systems may be lkea tested after installation at teh maixmum expected static pressure. Teh acceptable leakage criteria, often referred to as leakage class, should be carefully selectedc based on the hazards associated with the contaminant.



$$\dfrac{t}{D} =\sqrt[3]{0.035814 p \dfrac{(1- v^2)} {E} (52 + D) }$$ 

where:

t - the thickness of the duct in inches
D - the diameter of tehe duct in inches
p - the intensity of the negative pressure on teh duct in psi
E - modulus of elasticity in psi
v - Poisson's ratio

The designer is encouraged to use SMACNA standards for complete engineering design procedures for Class 2 - 4 

- Hoods should be a minimum of two gauges heavier than straight section of connection branches, free of sharp edges  or burrs, and reinforced to provide necessary stiffness.
- Longitudinal joint or seams should be welded.
- Duct system subject to wide temperature fluctuations should be provided with expansion joints.
- Elbows and bends should be a minum of two gauges heavier than straight lenght of equal dimater and have a centerline radius of at least two and preferably two and one-half times the pipe diameter.
- Elbows of 90$^{\circ}$ should be of a five piece construction for round ducts up to 6 in and of a seven piece construction for larger diameter. Bends less tha 90$^{\circ}$ should have a proportional number of pieces.
-   Air contamimant includes particulate that may settle in the ducts, clean-out doors should be provided in horizontal runs, near elbows, junctions, and vertical runs. The spacing of clean-out door should not exceed 12 ft for duct in 12 in diameter and less but may be great for larger duct sizes.
- Transitions in main and sub-mains should be tapepered. The taper should be at least five units long for each one unit change in diameter.
- All branches should enter the mian at the center of the transition at an angle not to exceed 45${^\circ}$
- Where the condensation may occur, thee duct system hsould be liquid tight and provisions shoudl be made for proper sloping and drainage.
- A straight duct section of at least six equivalent duct diameters should be used when connecting to a fan. Elbowsx or other fitting at teh fan inlet will seriously reduce the volume discharge.
- Discharge stacks should be vertical and terminate at a point where height or air vbelocity lmit re-entry into supply air inlets or other plant opennings.

#### System Details

- Provide duct supports of sufficient capacity to carry the weight of the system plus the weight of the duct half filled with material and with no load placed on connecting equipment.
- Provide adequate clearance between ducts and ceilings, walls and floors for installation and maintenance.
- Install fire dampers, explosion vents, etc, in accordance with NFPA codes.
- Avoid using blast gates or other dampers. To reduce tampering, provide a means of locking dampers in place after the adjustment has been made.
- Allow for vibration and expansion. If no other considereation make it inadvisable, provide a felxible connection between the duct and the fan.
- Exhaust fans handling explosive or falmmable atmospheres required special construction.
- Do not allow hoods ahnd duct to be added to an existing exhaust system unless provided for in the original design
- Locate fans and filtration equiopment such that maintenance access is easy.
