#### Basic definitions

**Ejectors** are used sometimes if it is not desirable to have contaminanted air pass direclty through the air moving device. Ejectors are utilized for air streams containing corrosive, flammable, explosive, hot, or sticky materials that might damage a fan.

**Axial Fans** There are three basic types of axial fans: propeller, tubeaxial,
 and vaneaxial.
 
** Propeller Fans** are used for moving air against low static pressures and are used commonly for general ventillation.
 
 **Tubeaxial Fans** contain narrow or propeller-type blades in a short, cylindrical housing normally without any type of straightening vanes. Tubeaxial fans will mnove air againstg moderate pressure (less than 2"wg)
 
 **Vaneaxial Fans** have propeller configuratoin with a hub and airfoil blades mounted in cylindrical housing which normally incorporate straightening vanes on the discharge side of the impller. These are rated for higher pressures >>  up to 8"wg
 
 
 ##### Centrifugal Fans
 
 *cursory notes*
**Forward curved**  impllers have blades which curve toward the direction fo rotation. 

**Radial Impellers** have blades which are straight or radial to the hug. The housings are desgined with their inlets and outlets sized to produce material conveying velocities. This fan design is used for most exhaust system applications when particulates will pass through the fan.

**Backward Inclided/Baclward Curved** impeller blades are included opposite to the directoin of fan rotation. This type usally has higher tip speeds and provoide high fan efficiency.

#### Special Type Fans

*In-line Centrifual Fans * have backward included blades with special housing which permit a striahgtl ine duct installation. Pressure versus housings which eprmit a straihgt line duct installation. Pressure vs flow rate vs horsepower performamhnce curves are similar to a scroll-type centrifugal fan of the same blade same blade. Spacial requirements match vaneaxial fans.


#### Considerations for Fans Selection:


Flow Rate (Q): Based on system requirements and expressed as actual cubic feet per minutes (acfm) at the fan inlet.

Pressure Requirements: Based on suystem pressure requirements which normally are expressed as FSP and FTP in inches of water gauge at standard conditions. If the reqired pressure is known only at non standard conditions, a desnity correction must be made.

#### Air Stream

**Material handled through the fan** When the exhaust air contains a small maount of smoke or dust, a backward inclined centrifugal or axial fan should be selected. With light dust, fume or moisture, a backward include or radial cenrifugal fan would be the preferred selection. If the particular loading is high, or when material is handled, the normal selection would be a radial centrifugal fan.


**Explosive or Flammable Material** Use spark ressitance construction conforming to the NFPA standard.

### Replacement Air


Air will enter a building in an amount equal to the flow rate  of exhaust air whetehre or not provision is made for this replacement. However, the actual exhaust flow raet will be less than the design value if the plan is udner negative pressure. If the building perimeter is tihgly seale,d thus blocking effective infiltration lf ourdoor air, a sever devrease of the exhaust flow rate will resutlt

Experience has shown that replacemnet iar is necessary for the following reasons:

1. To insure that ehxuast hoods operate properly. A lack of replacement air and the attendant negative pressure conditon results in an increase in the static presure the exhaust fans  must overcome. This can cause a reduction in exhaust flow rate fro all fans and is particulary serioues with low-pressure fans such as wall fans and roof exhausters.
2.  To eliminate high-velocity cross-drafts through windows and doors. Dependo n the negative pressure created, cross drafts may be substantilan. Cross-drafts not only interfer with the proper operation of exhaust hoods, but also may disperse contaimnated air from one section of the building to another and can interfere with the propler opoeration of process equipment such as oen top solvent degreasers operation of exhaust hoods, but also may disperse contaimnated air from one section of the building to another and can interfere with the propler opoeration of process equipment such as oen top solvent degreasers. In the case of dusty operations, settled material may be dislodged from srufaces and result in recontamination of the workroom.
3.  To insure operation of natural draft stacks such as combustion flues. Moderate negative pressure can result in backdrafting of flues in whic may cause a dangerous healht hazard from the release of combustion products, principally carbon monoxide, into the workroom. Back drafting may occur in nautral draft stacks at negative pressures.
4. To eliminate cold drafts on workers. Draft not olny cause discomfort and reduce working efficient but also may result in lower overall ambient temperatures.
5. To eliminate differential pressure on doors. High diffenretial pressure make doors difficultg to open or shut and,  in some instances, can cause personnel safety hazards when the doors move in an uncontrollable fashion.
6. To conserve fuel. Without adequate replacement air, uncomfortable cold conditions near the building perimeter frequently lead to the installation of more heating equpment in those ares in an attempt to correct the problem. These heates take an excessive amount of time  to warm the air and over-heated air moving toward the building inteior makes those areas uncomfortabley warm. This in turn leads to the installation of more exhaust fans to remove teh excess heat, further aggravating the problem. Heat is waste without cuirng hte problem. The fuel consumption with a replacement air heating system usually is lower than whe attempts are made to achieve comfort without replacement air.


#### Replacement Air Distribution

Replacement air distribution is as critical as iar volume in industrial ventilation system design. Poor air dstribution can destoy the control provided by a well-designed exhaust system.

Designers often use teh general heating, ventilating, and air conditions ysstem or plan air system to provide the supplly air to replace air exhaust by local exhast hoods. Unfortunately, plan air systems use high throw diffuser to mix the warmer/coller air with the air already in the plant. May times the throw distance is over 40 feet. Sometimes hoods can not capture contaminants and overcome turbulence. If the suuply air system does not sufficiently cool the employees, pedestal fans are often used. Pedestal fans also destroy contaminant control by causing turbulence near the local exhaust hood and should not be allowed.

 One method of providing non-turbulent aiar to the facility is to pass air thorugh a supply air lnenum built as part of the ceiling and/or through perforated duct. Cover the plemum face wiht perforated sheet metal. The ceiling plemnum or duct runs should cover as large and area as possible to diffuse the air flow. A plenum wall providing cross-flow ventilation can be used only ifthe wrokers position themselves between the supplyu air system and the contaminant source and should be used if the design velocity is over 100 fpm.
 
 High velocity flow into the plenum will cause the same turbulence problems asthelarge dciffusers commonly found  in plants that attempt to thorow the air to the floor. Consider feeding the plneum with perforated duct to diffuse the air inside the plenum. 
 
 HIgh velocity flow intothe plenum will cause the same turbulence problems as the large diffusers commonlyu foundin palnts that attempt to throw the air to the floor. Consider feeidng the plenum with perfrated duct to diffuse the iar inside the plenuim. Another method of distributing air flow, from either aceiling or wall-mounted plenum, is to design the plenum with two perforoated pltes, one fixed and one adjustable, located 2-6 inches apart. 
 
 #### Replacement Airflow Rate
 
 In most cases, replacement air flow rate should approximate the total air flow rate of air removed from building removed by exhaust ventilation systems, procoess systems and combustion systems. Determination of the actual flow rate of air removed usually requires an inventory, it is necessary not only to deetermine the quantity of air removed, but also the need for a particular piece of equipoment. At the same time, reasonable projections should be made of the totla plant exhaust requirememtsn forthe next one to two years, particularly if pricess changes or plant expansions are contemplated. In such cases it can be practical to purchase a replacement air unit slightly larger than immediately necessary with the knowledge that the increased capacity will be within a short time. The addiotnal cost of a larger unit is relatively smal land in most cases the fan drive can be regulated to supply only the desired quantity of air.
 
 
 Having established the minimum air supply quantity necessary for replacement air purposes, many plants have found that it is wise to provide additioanl supply air flow rate to overcome natural ventilation leakage and further minimize drafts at the perimetera of the building.
 
 ### Room Pressure
 
In some situations negative pressures may be desired. An example is a room or area where a contaimant must be prevent from esacping into the surroudning area. It also may  be desired to maintain a room or area under positive pressure to maintain a clean environment. Either of these conditions can be achieved by setting and maintaining the proopelr exhaust/supply flow differential. Negatrive pressure can be achieved by setting the exhaust volumetric flow rate (Q) from the area to a level higher than supply rate. Positive pressure is achieve by setting the supply air flow rate higher than the exhaust rate. The proper flow differential will dpenedo n the physical conditions of the are, but a genearrl guide is to set a 5% flow different but no less than to cfm. If the volume flows vary during either negatively or positively pressureized processes, it is easier to maintain the desired room pressure by adjusting the supply air.

Some designer use transfer grilles and a pressure sensor in the room to maintain a desired room pressure. Air is allowed to seep from adjacent hallways, offices ando ther non-industrial areas. Do not used transfer grilles between areas where contaminant migration is possible.


Maximum utilization of the supply air is achieved when the air is disrtibuted in the "lvinign zone" of the space, below the 8-10 foot level. When delivered in this manner, where the majhority of the eple and process are located - maximum ventilation results with minimum air handling. To accomplish this, the air can be distributed uniformly in the space or where required for worker comfort. Heavy-duty, adjustable, direction grilles or lovers have proven to be very successful in allowing individual workers to direc the air as needed.

Multiple pont distribution is usually best since it provids uniformity of air delivery and minimizes the re-entrainment of contaminated air delivery and minimizew the re-entrainment of contaminat air that occurs when large volumes are "dumped" at relatively high velocities.

Whe large amounts of sensible heat are to be removed from the space during the winter months, it is most practical to plan for rapid mixing of the coler air supply with teh warmer air in the space. During the summer months, the best distribution usually involes minimum mixing so that the air supply will reach the worker at higher velocities and with a minimum of heat pickup. These results can be obtained by providing horizontal distribution of winter air over the worker's head, mixing before it reached the work area and directing the air toward the worker through register adjustment of the summer months.
