### Evaluation of employee exposure 


Under the equilibrium conditons, the following equations may be used to deteremine the concentration of a contaminant pemritted in the recirculation return air stream:


$C_r = \dfrac {(1 - \eta) (C_e - K_r C_m)}{1 -[(K_e) (1 - \eta)]}$

where:

$C_r$  - air cleaner discharge concentation after recirculation , $mg/m^3$
$\eta$ - fractional air cleaner efficiency
$C_E$ - local exhaust duct concentration before recirculation, $mg/m^3$
$K_R$  -coeffienct which reference a fraction of the recirculated exhaust stream that is composed of the recirculation air (range 0 to 1)
$C_M$ - replacement air concentration, $mg/m^3$


$$C_B = \dfrac{Q_B}{Q_A} (C_G - C_M) (1 - f) + (C_O - C_M) f + K_B C_R + (1 - K_B)(C_M)$$

where:

$C_B$ - 8 hr TWA worker breathing zone cocnetration after reciculation , $mg/m^3$
$Q_B$ - total ventilation air flow before recirculation 
$Q_A$ -t total ventilation air flow after recirculation
$C_G$ - general room cocnetration before recirculation, $mg/m^3$
f - coefficient which reps the fractoin fo tiem the wroker spends at the work station
$C_0$ - 8 hr TWA breathing zone contrnation at work station before recirculation
$K_B$ - fraction of worker's breahting zone air that is composed of reicurlation return air
(ranges 0 to 1)


Several ootential problems way exist in the design of recirculated air systems. Factor to be considered are:

1. Recirculating systems should, whenever practicalbe, be design to bypass to the outdoor, rather than to recirculate, when weather conditions permit. If a system is intended to conserver heat in winter months and if adequate window and door openings permit sufficient replacement of air is required at all times, such continuous bypass operation would not be attractive.

2. Wet collectors also act as humidifiers. Recirculation of humid air from such euqpiment can cause uncomfortably high humidiyty and required auxiliary ventilation or some means must be used to prevent excess humidity.

3. The exit concentration of typical collectors can vary with time. Design data and testing progarms hsould consider all operatonal time periods.

4. The laytout and design of the recirculation duct should provide adeqaute mixing with other supply air and avoid uncomfortable drafts on workers or air currents which would upset teh capture velocity of local exhaust hoods.
5. A secondary air cleaning system, as described in teh esxample on particulate recirculation, is preferable to a monitoring device because it is usually more reliable and required a less sophisticated degree of maintenance.
6. Odors or nuisance value of contaminats should be considered as well as teh official TLV values. In some areas, adequatgely cleaned reciruclated airm provided by a system with safeguards, may be of better quality than the ambient outdoor air available for replacement air
7. Routing testingm, maitenance procedures, and records should be develop for recirculating systems.
8. Periodic testing of the workroom air should be provided.
9. An appropriate sign shall be displayed in a prominent place reading as follows:

>air containing hazardous substances is being cleaned to a safe level in this euqipment and return to the building. signals or laarms indicate malfunctions and must receive immediate attention: stop recirculation, discharge the air outside,  or stop the process immediately.
