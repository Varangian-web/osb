### Preliminary steps


Coordinate design efforts with all personnel involved, including the equipment or process operator as well as maintenance, helath, safety, fire, and environmental personnel. The deisng should have, at a minimum, the following data aailable at the start of the design calculations:

1. A layout of the oeprations, workroom, building (if necessary) , etc. The available location(s) for the air clenaing device and fan should be determine. Locate the system exhaust point so that teh discharged air will not re-enter the work space.


2. A line sketch of the duct system layout, including plan and elevation dimensions, fan location, air cleaning device location, etc. Number, letter, or otherwise idnetify each branch and section of main duct on thne line sketch for convenience. Locate the fan close to pieces of equpment with high losses. This will facilitate balancing and may result in lower operating costs. Flexible duct is susceptible to sagging and excessive bending, which increases static pressure losses.
3.  A design or skethc ofhte desired hood for each operation with directio nand evelation of outlet for duct connection.
4.  Information about the details of the operation(s), specifically toxicity, ergonomics, physical andchemical characteristics, required flow rate, minimum required duct velocity, entry losses, and required capture velocities.
5.  Consider the method and location of the replacement of air distribution devices on the hoods perfromance. The type and location of these fixtuyres can dramatically lower contaminant control by creating undersirable turbulence at the hood.



### Design Procedure

Following procedure shall result in workable system design:

1. Select or design each exhaust hood based on toxicity, physical and chemical characteristics of the material and the ergnomic of the process and determine its design flow rate. Note that minimum duct veloity is only improt for system transporting particulates , condensing vapors, or mis and to prevent explosive contration building up in the duct.

2. Start with the duct segment that has the greatest nuer of duct segments between it and the fan. A duct segment if defined as the constant diameter round duct that separte point of interest such as good, entry points, fan inlet, etc

3. Determine the duct area by dividng the design flow rate by minimum duct velocity. Convert the resultant cross-sectional area into a tentative duct diameter. A commercially available duct size should be selected (ref Table 5-8). If solid particulates or condesable vapor are being transported a minimum velocity is required. If the tentative duct diameter is not a standard size, select the next smaller size to esure that the actual duct velocity is equal to greater than the minimum required.

4. Using the line sketch, determine the design length for each duct segment and the number and tpye of fitting (elbows, entries, and other special fittings) needs. Design length is the centerline distance along the duct.

5. Calculate the pressure losses for the duct segmenet that merge at a common junction point

6. Directly after each junction piont, there must one and only one SP, reglardless of the path taken to reach that point. If not ensured by the design process, thesystem will "self-balance itself by reducing theflow rate in the higher-resistance duct segment(s) and increasing the flow rate in the lower-resistance duct segment(s) unti lthere is a single SP in the duct downstream of each junction point. SP balance at nay junction point can be achieved by either one fo the two fundamental design methods :
	- Adjust the flow rate throug hthe hodd(s) until the SPs at each junction piont are the same
	- Increase the resistance in the low resistance duct segemnt(s0 by means of some artificial device such as a blast gate, orifice plate, or other obstruction in the segment.
7. Select both the air cleaning device and fan based upon final calculated system flow rate, temperature, moisture condition, contaminant, contaminant loading, physical and chemical characteristics, and overall system resistance.
8. Check the duct sizes designed against the avalable space and resolve any interference problems. This may cause a redesign of part of the system.
9. Determine the material type and thickness (gauge) for each duct segment based on the air stream characteristics.



### Duct Segment Calculations


The Velocity Pressure (VP) Method is based on the fact that all frictional and dynamic (fitting) losses in ducts and hoods are functions of the velocity pressure and can be calculated by loss coefficient multipied by the velocity pressure.
Loss coefficients for hoods are show in Figures 5-15 to 5-16.
Friction data for this methods are present under Tables 5-5 and 5-6 [[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=149]]


Reference Colebrook-White equation for exact calc >> expected 4% variance in the prosed.

Stesp to deteremined the overall presusre losso f a duct segment that start at the hood. VP >0 always while SP <> 0 .

1. Determine the actual velcoity by dividng the flow rate by the area of the commercial duct size chosen. Then determine thecorresponsing velocity pressure from Table 5-7. 
2. Determine the hood static pressure 
3. Multiply the design duct legnth by the loss coefficient fom the Tables 5-5 and 5-6.
4. Determine the number and type of fitting in the duct segment. For each fitting type determine loss coefficient and multiply the number of fittings 
5. Add the result to steps 3 and 4 abovce and multiply by duct VP. This is the actual lossi n inches of water for the duct segment
6. Add the result of Step 5 to the hood suction. If there are any additonla losses (expressed in inches of water), such as for an air cleaning device, add them in also. This established teh cumulative energy required, expressed as static pressure, to move the design lfow rate through the duct segment.

### Distribution of Air Flow

#### Balance by Design Method:

Procedure provides for ahcievement of desired air flow without the use of blast gates. Otherwise know as "Static Pressure Balance Method". Start with the hood farthest from the fan and proceed segment by segment to the fan. At each junction, teh static pressure necessary to achieve desired flow in one stream must equal the static pressure in the joining air streams.

#### Blast Gate Method:

Procedures rests on the use of blast gates which must be adjust after intellation to achieve teh desired flow at each hood. At each junction, the flow rates of two joining duct are achieve by blast gat adjustment which results in the desired static pressure balance. Assumption that only suset of hoods would be used at one time may aid this calculation.

#### Choice of Methods

Balance design method is used where toxic or explosive substance are present.

#### Balance by Design procedure

Where static pressure by parallel paths are unequal, balance be obtained by increasing the air flow  through the run with the lower resistance.
$$Q_correct = Q_design \sqrt{ \dfrac{SP_{gov}}{SP_{duct}}}$$

gov == "governing sp"


#### System Redesign

Many vbenmtilation system are change after intallation. When such changes occur, the offer of the supposed ventilation system should be claculated.


#### Plenum Exhaust Systems

Plenum exhaust system differ from hood exhaust system >> minimum transport velocities are maintained only in the branch ducs to prevent settling of particulate matter; the main ducts to prevent of partciulate matter; the main duct is oversize and velocities are allowed to decrease far below normal vbalues, many timesx before 2000 fpm. The function of the main duct is to provide a low-pressure loss path for air flow from the various branches to the air clean or teh fan.

Advantage of the plenum-type exhaust system include:

1. Branch ducts can be added, removed, or relocated at any convenint point along the main duct.
2. Branch ducts can be closed of and the flow ratein the entire system reduced, provided minimum transport velocities are maintained in the remaining branches.
3. The main duct can act as a primary separtor (settling chamber) for large particulatte matter and refuse materail which might be undesirable in the air clean or fan.

Limitations of this design:

1. Sticky, linty materials, such as buffing dust, tend to clog the main duct. It may be expectedc taht greatest difficult with be encountered with the drag chain type of cleaing, but the other types will be susceptible to buildup as well.
2. Materials that are subject to direct or spontaneous combnstion must be handled with care. Wodd dust has been handled successfully in systems of this type; buffing dust and lint are subject to this limintaito nand are not recommended. EXplosive dusts such as magnesium, aluminum, titanium, or grain dusts should be handeld in this system type.o


#### Fan Pressure Calculations

Exhaust system calculation are based on static presure; that is, all hood static pressures and balancing or governing pressure at the duct junctions are given as static pressure which can be measured directly 


**Fan Total Pressure** is the increase in pressure thorugh or across the fan and can express by the equation 

$FTP = TP_{outlet} - TP_{inlet}$

$\therefore T P = SP +VP$
$FTP = (SP_{outlet} + VP_{outlet} - (SP_{inlet} + VP_{inlet})$

##### Fan Static Pressure

**definition** the static pressure of the fan is the total pressure diminished by the fan velocity pressure. The fan velocity pressure is defined as the pressure corresonding to the air velocity at the fan outlet.

$FSP = FTP - VP_{inlet}$
or 
$FSP = SP_{outlet} - SP_{inlet} - VP_{inlet}$


Example : [[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=118]]


#### Correctoin for Velocity Changes

Energy entering each of the air streams >> 

$Q(TP)= Q(SP + VP)$

$Q_1(VP_1 + SP_1) + Q_2(VP_2 + SP_2) = Q3(VP_3 + SP_3) + losses$


where losses:

$Losses = F_1 Q_1 VP_1 + F_2 Q_2 VP_2$

Given:
$SP_1 = SP_2$
$Q_3 = Q_1 + Q_2$

$VP_r = (\dfrac{Q_1} {Q_3}) VP_1 + (\dfrac{Q_2}{Q_3}) VP_2$

where:

$VP_r$= resultant velocity presssure of the combined branches
$Q_1$ = flow rate in branch # 1 
$Q_2$ = flow rate in branch # 2 
$Q_3$ = combined flow rate leaving the junction


If $VP_3$ > $VP_r$ then accelation has occured and SP decreased, and vice versa


The correction is:

$SP_3 = SP_1 - (VP_3 - VP_r)$

where:
$SP_3$ = SP in main # 3
$SP_1$ = SP in branch # 1 = SP at branch # 2
$VP_3$ = velocity pressure in main # 3


### Friction loss for non-circular ducts

Round duct are preferred for industrial exhaust systems because they provide a more uniform air velocityto resists settl.ing of material and an abillity to wihstand higher static pressure.

Reference Table 5-5 and 56 in conjuction to Table 5-9  for friction losses of rectangular sections.

Pressure losses of the duct are as follows:

1. Find duct cross-sectional area, $ft^2$  A
2. Find wetted perimeter, $ft$ P
3. Calculate hydraulic radius, $ft$ R ($R = /dfrac{A}{P})
4. Convert R to inches r  (r = 12R)
5. Calculate equivalent diameter, in D (D = 4r)
6. Use the proper friction talbe based on the equivalent diameter and flow rate ( or velocity)

#### Psychrometric Principles;
The properties of moist air are presented on the psychrometric chart a single pressure. These parameters define the physical poroperties of an air/water bvapor mixture. The actual gas flow rat and the density of the gas stream at the inlet of the fan must be know in order to select the fan. The psychrometric chart provides the ifnroiatmion required to calculate chang in th flow rate and density of the gas as it passes throug the various exhaust system components. These properties are:

- Dry-bulb Temperature is the tempeartue observed with na ordinary thermometer. Expressed in degrees Fahrenhet, it may be read directly on the chart and is indicated on the bottom horizontal scale.
- Web-bulb Temperature is the temperature at which liquid or solid water, by evaporating into air, can bring the air to saturation adiabitaically at the same temperature. Expressed in degrees Fahrenheit, it is read directly at the intersection fothe contant enthalpy line with the 100 \% saturation curve.

**Dew Point Temperature** is that temperature at which teh air in an air/vapor mixture become saturated with water vapor and any further reduction of dry bulb temperature causes the water vapor to cond3ense or deposit as drops of water. Expressed in degrees Fahrenheit, it is read directly at the intersection of the saturation curve with a horizontal line representing constant moistune contnet.

**Density Determination** When the quality of an air/vapor mixture is determiend by a point on a psychrometreic chart having a family of density factor curves, all that must be done to determine the acutal dcensity of the gas at the pressure reference  for whic hteh chart is drawn is to multiply the density favtor taken by the density of the standard air.


$\rho = /dfrac { 1 + W} { HV}$

where:
$\rho$ = density of the mix ($lbm/ft^3$)
W = moisture content ($lbm H_2 O/lbm$ dry air)
HV = humid volume ($ft^32 mix/lbm$ dry air)


It has been determined that the air pollution control system shoud include a cyclone for dry product recovery and a high-energy wet collector. These devices have the following operatin characteristics.

#### Correction to the flow

Flow must be correct to the actual moisture, temperaturem and pressure which exist in the duct.


##### Step 1A:
Find the amount (weight) of water vapor exhausted.
Dryer discharge = 60 tons/hr of dried material
Dry capacity to remove moisture >> 5%

Moisture removed = (feed rate) - (discharge rate)

##### Step 1B:

Find the amount of dry weight exhausted.
Exhaust  rate, lbs/min = (16,000 scfm) (0.065 lb/$ft^3$) = 1200 lbs/min dry air

##### Step 1C:

Knowing hte water-to-dry air ratio and the temperature of the mixutre, it is possible to determined other quantities of the air-to-water mixture.


$W = 0.089 lbs H_2 O/lb$ dry air
Dry bulb temperature = 500 F (given)


##### Step 1D:

ref : [[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=146]]

Find actual gas flow rate (acfm)

Exhaut flow rate, acfm = (humid volume) (weights of dry air/min)

Step2 :

Size the duct. Minimum conveying velocity of 4000 fpm is given. Suction of the dry air is - 2.0 "wg corresponds to hood suction.

Step 2A;

The actual velocity pressure in the duct is given by:

$VP_actual = (df) VP_std)$

where : 

df - density factor


Step3

Calculate the pressure from A to B and determine static pressure at Point B

Step 4
 The pressure loss of the cyclone is provide by the manufacturer.
 
 
 Step 5
 The calculation from Point C to D is the same as A to B
 
 
 Step 6
 
 Wet collectors can himidify a gas stream. 
 
 
 The himidifying efficient of a given device :
 
 $\eta_n \dfrac {T_i - T_0} {T_i - T_s} \times 100$
 
 where:
 
 $\eta_n$ - himidifying efficiency, %
 $T_i$ - dry-bulb temperature at collector inlet, F
 $T_o$ - dry-bulb temperature at collector outlet, F
 $T_s$ - adiabatic saturation temperature , F
 
 
 or 
 
 $\eta_n = \dfrac{W_i - W_o}{W_i - W_s} \times 100$
 
where:

$W_i$ - moisture content in $lb H_2 0/lb$ dry air inlet
$W_o$ - moisture content in $lb H_2 O/lb$ dry air outlet
$W_s$ - moisture contentin $lb H_2 O/lb$ dry air at adabatic saturation conditions


Step 6A

Find the qualify of the air to water mixture at Point 2, the collector dust

Humidifying efficiency = 90%. Dry-bulb Temperature at Collector Inlet = 5000 F .o

Step 7 

What is the exhaust flow rate in acfm and the density factor at the collector outlet.

Step 7A

Exhaust flow rate = ( humid volume) (weight of dry air/min). Humid Volume from Step 6 is 20.5 $ft^3/lb$ dry air. 

Step 7 B 

On low-pressure exhaust systems , where the negative pressure at teh fan inlet is less than 20" wg, the effect of the negative pressure is usually ignored. However as the pressure decreases,it is understood that gases expand to occupy a larger volumen. Unless this larger volume is anticipated and the fan sized to handle the larger volume is anticiopatedc and the fan sized to handle the larger flow rate, it will have the effect of reducing the amount of air that is pulledi nto the hood at the beginning of the system. From the characterisitc equation for the 8ideal gas law  $PQ = wRT$ w - mass flow rate in lbm/min

$P_1 Q_1 = P_2 Q_2$




Step 7 B 

On low-pressure exhaust systems , where the negative pressure at teh fan inlet is less than 20" wg, the effect of the negative pressure is usually ignored. However as the pressure decreases,it is understood that gases expand to occupy a larger volumen. Unless this larger volume is anticipated and the fan sized to handle the larger volume is anticiopatedc and the fan sized to handle the larger flow rate, it will have the effect of reducing the amount of air that is pulledi nto the hood at the beginning of the system. From the characterisitc equation for the 8ideal gas law  $PQ = wRT$ w - mass flow rate in lbm/min

$P_1 Q_1 = P_2 Q_2$


Step 7 C

Pressure also affects the density of the air.

$$\dfrac{(w_1 \div Q_1) RT_1}{(w_2 \div Q_2) RT_2} = \dfrac {P_1} {P_2}$$


Step 7D

Determine the velocity of the duct

Step 7E 

Calculate the duct pressure loss


Step 8

Calculate the presure loss from the fan discharge F to stack discharge G. The static pressure at the eixt of the stack must be atmospheric, therefore, the static repssure at the fan exit is positive.


Step 9

Actual FSP = $SP_oyut - SP_in - VP_in$

Step 10

Determine equivalent fan static pressure in order to enter fan rating table. Equivalent fan static pressure is determined by divind the actual fan static pressure by the density factor at teh fan inlet.


Step 11

Select fan from rating tagble using the equivalent fan SP and the fan inlet flow rate. 

Step 12

Determine the actual required fan power. Since actual density is less than standard air density, the actul required power is determiend by multiplying by the density factor.




### Exhaust Stack Outlets

The effecto of wind on stack height varies with speed:


- At very low wind speeds, the exhaust jet from a vertical stack will rise above teh roof level resulting in significant dilution at the air intakes.
- Increasing wind speed will decrease plum rise and consequently decrease dilution.
- Increasing wind speed will increase turbulence and consequently increase dilution.

$R = B_s^{0.67} \times B_l^{0.33}$

where: 

$B_s$ - smaller diameter
$B_l$ = larger diameter
if B_l > B_s  >> B_l = 8 B_s

$H_c = 0.22 R$
$X_c = 0.5 R$
$L_c = 0.9 R$

$L_r$ = 1.0 R


The ideal design extends the stack high eough that the expanding plume does not meet the wake region boundary.

The stack is extended s othat teh expanding plme does not intersect the high turbulence region or any reciculation cavity.

When the intake is above the high turbulence boundary, extend a line from the top of the intake to the stack with a slope of 1:5.


In large buildings with many air intakese, the above oprocedure will result in very tall stacks, An alternate approach is to estimate the amouynt of dilution that is afforded by stack heihgt, distance betweent the stack and the air intake and internal dilution that occurs wihtinn the system itself. This approach is presented in ASHRAE.


##### Stack Consideration.

1. Discharge velocity and gas temperature influence the effective stack height.
2. Wind can cause a downwash into the wak of the stack reducing the effective stack height. Stack velocity should be at least 1.5 times the wind velocity to prevent downwash.

3. A good stack velocity is 3000 fpm because it:
	- Prevents downwash for winds up to 2000 fpm(22 mph). higher wind speeds have significant dilution effects.
	- Increases effective stack height.
	- Allows selection of a smaller centrifugal exhaust fan to provide a more stable operation point on the fan curve
	- Provides conveying velcoity if there is dust in the exhuast or there is a failure of the air cleaing device.

4. High exit velocity is a poor substsitute for stack height. 
5. The terminal velocity of rain is about 2000 fpm. A stack veloctiy above 2600 fpm will prevent rain from entering the stack when the fan is operating.
6. Locate stacks on the highest roof of the building when possible. 
7. The use of an architectural screen should be avoided. The screen becomes an obstancle and the stack must be raised to avid the wake effect of the screen.
8. The best stack shpae is a straight cylinder. If a drain is required, a vertical stack head is preferred.
9. Rain caps should not be used. Teh rain cap directs the air toward teh roof, incresases the possibility of reentry, and causes exposure to maintenance personnel on the roof. moreover, rain caps are not effective.
10. Separating the exhaust points from the air intakes can reduce the effect of renetry by increasing dilution.
11. In some circumstances, several smal.l exhuast systems can be manifolded to a signle exhaust duct to provide internal dilution thereby reducing reentry.
12. A combined approach of vertical discharge, stack height, remove air intakes, propler air cleaning device, and internal dilution can be effective in reducing the consequences of reentry.
13. A tall stack is not an adequate substitue for good emission control.
