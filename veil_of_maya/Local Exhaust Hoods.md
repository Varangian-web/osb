### Contaminant characteristics


Inerrtial effects : 


Range of capture velocities : 

[[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=52]]


Release with practically no velocity into quiet air => 50 - 100 fpm


Sources of air motion:

- Thermal air currents , especilaly as by a grinding wheel, belt, conveyor , etc
- Material motion, as in dumping or container filing.
- Movements of the operator.
- Room air currents(which are usually takenh at 50 fpm minimum and may be much higher)
- Rapid air movement caused by spot coling and heating equipment


Capture velocity:

The minimum hood-inducedc air velocity necessary to caputre and convey the contaminant into the hood is referred to as the capture velocity.o



The velocity at point X on the sphere surface is

$Q = V(4 \pi x^2) = 12.57 V x^2$

where:

Q - air flow into suction point, cfm
V - velocity at distance X, fpm
A - 4 $\pi x^2$ - area of sphere, ft^2
x - radious of a sphere, ft


for unbounded line source

$Q = V (2 \pi x L^2) = 6.28 VXL$

General characterization for round and rectangular good

$Q = V ( 10 x^2 + A)$

where:
Q - air flow, cfm
V - centerline velocity at X distance from hood, fpm
x - distance outward along axis in ft
A - area of hood opening $ft^2$
D - diameter of rund hoods or side of essentially squate hoods, ft


where x > 1.5 D the flow rante increases less rapidly with distance.

The hood entry loss represents the energy necessary to accelerate the air form rest to duct velocity. This may be expressed as:


$SP_h = h_e + VP_d$
$SP_h = (F_s)(VP_s) + (F_d) (VP_D) + VP_d$

where:
$h_e$ - overall hood etrny loss = $h_s + h_d$, "wg
$h_s$ - slot or opeing loss = $(F_s )(VP_s)$, "wg
$h_d$ - duct entry loss = $(F_d)(VP_d)$, "wg
$F_s$ - loss coefficient for slot
$F_d$ - loss coefficient for duct entry
$VP_S$ - slot or opeing veloctiy pressure "wg
$VP_d$ - dust velocity pressure , "wg



Simple hood is a hood with face velocity < 1000 fpm. Face velocities above 1000 fpm may occur with only small face area hooods.


Push Jet
#formula #pushjet
[[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=65]]

$\dfrac {Q_x}{Q_0} = 1.2 \sqrt{(\dfrac{ax}{b_0}) + 0.41}$

$\dfrac {V_x} {V_0} = \dfrac {1.2} {\sqrt{\dfrac{ax}{b_0} +0.41}}$


where;

$Q_0$ - the push nozzle supply flow
$Q_x$ - the jet flow rate at a distance x from the nozzle
$V_0$ - the push nozzle exit air velocity
$V_x$ - the peak push jet velocity at a distance x
a - a coefficient characteristic of the nozzle (0.13 for slots and pipes)
x - distance from the nozzle
$b_0$ - tehe slot width >> if the nozzle is freely suspected,$b_0$ is equal to one-half the total slot width. If the nozzle is poston on or very near ap lace surface $b_0$ is equal to full slot width.


The nozzle may be constructed as a long thin slot, a pipe with holes or indiviudal nozzles. The total nozzle exit area should not exceed 50% of the nozzle plemun cross-sectional area to assure even flow distribution.


#### Pull hood.

The hood pull flow should be approximately1.5- 2.0 the push flow which reaches teh hood. If design criteria specifying pull flow rate are not available Eq 3.6 can be used. >> push jet equation  [[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=65]]


The hood opening height should be the same as teh wdith of the expanded jet, if possible. However, smaller opening heights are acceatpbel if the hood flow rate meets the 1.5-2.0 times jet flow criteria.
#### Push pull system design

When designing in accordance with Equation 3.7 a push velocity ($V_x$) of 150-200 fpm at the exhaust ghood face should be specified.


Design for hot processes.

**Circulate high canopy**

As the heated air rises, it mixes turbulently with the surroudning air . This result in an increaign air column diameter and voumetric flow rate. The diameter of the colum ca be approximatecd by :


$D_c = 0.5 x_c^0.88$

where:

$D_c$ - column diameter at hood face
$x_c$ - y + z - the distance from the hypothetical point source to the hood face, ft
$y$ - distance from the process surface to the hood face, ft
$z$ - distance from the process surface to the hypothetical point source, ft

"z" can be calculated:

$z = (2 \Delta_s)^1.138$

where: 

\Delta_s - diameter of hot source, fto



Velocity of the rising hot air column can be calculated:

$V_f = 8 (A_s)^0.33 \dfrac{(\Deltat)^9.42}{x_c^0.25)

where:

$V_f$ - velocity of hot air column at the hood face, fpm
$A_s$ - area of the hot source, $ft^2$
$\Delta t$ - the temperature difference between the hot source and the ambient air, F
$x_c$ = y+z - the distanc from the hypothetical point source to the hod face ,ft


The diameter of the hood face must be larger than the diameter fo the rising hot air column to assure completey capture. The hood diameter:


$D_f = D_c = 0.8y$

where:

$D_f$ - diameter of the hood face, ft

Total hood air flow rate is

$Q_t = V_f A_c + V_r(A_f - A_c)$


where:

$Q_t$ - total volume entering hood, cfm
$V_f$ - velocity of hot air column at the hood face, fpm
$A_c$ - area of the hot air column at the hood face, $ft^2$
$V_r$ - the required air velocity through the remaining hood area, fpm
$A_f$ - total are of hood face, $ft^2$

[[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf#page=67]]


### Low Canopy Hoods


Total flow rate for a circulate low canopy hood:

$Q_t = 4.7 ( D_f)^{2.33} (\Delta t)^{0.41}

where :

$Q_t$ - total hood air flow, cfm
$D_f$ - diameter of hood ,ft
$\Delta t$ - different between temperature of the hot source and ambient, F

The total flow rate for a rentangular low hood i

$\dfrac{Q_f}{L} = 6.2 b^{1.33} \Delta t^0.42$

where

$Q_t$ - total hood air flow, cfm
$L$ - length of the rectangular hood, ft
$b$ - width of the rectangular hood, ft
$\Delta t$ - difference between temperatureof the hot source and the ambient F
