### General

Requirements for outdoor air for offices based on an occupancy of seven people per 1000 sq ft is currently 20 cfm per person. Temperature and humidityh can play a role in how poepole perceive indoor environment. ASHRAE standard 55 provides guidance in design and maitenance of indoror thermal enviroments. ASHRAE recommends temperature range of 67 or 76 F  and 72 to 81 in summer. The average air movement should not exceed 30 fpm in winter and 50 fpm in summer.



### HVAC

#### Outdoor Air


Temperature method:


$$percent_outdoor_air = \dfrac{t_{RA} - t_{MA}}{{t_{RA} - t_{OA}} \times 100$$

where:

$t_RA$ - temperature, return air
$t_MA$ - temperature, mixed air
$t_OA$ - temperature, outdoor air


Carbon Dioxide method:

$$percent_outdoor_air = \dfrac{{ppm/RA - ppm/MA}{ppm/RA - ppm/OA}} \times 100$$

where:

ppm/RA  = $CO_2$ concentration. return air 
ppm/MA = $CO_2$ concentration, mixed air
ppm/OA = $CO_2$ cocnetration, outdoor air
