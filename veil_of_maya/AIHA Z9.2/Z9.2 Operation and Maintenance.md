### Operation and Maintenance
[[ANZI AIHA Z9.2 STANDARD]]


In abscence of manufacturers instruction, refer to the Appendix "Industrial Ventilation Maintenance Checklist "


 *Insert reference here*


### Testing, Balancing, and Operational Checks


Performance criteria usualy include such parameters as: #parameters

- hood static pressure,
- minimum air volume flowrate, 
- average, minimum, and maximum hood face velocities,
- visual containment
- measured containment performance factors,
- capture velocity
- slot velocity
- ASHRAE 110 ratings
- SEMI F15 requirements
- transport velocity 
- pressure drop across air cleaners
- fan total pressure
- motor amperage


Suggested test protocol may reference ASHRAE 110 test method, the SEMI S6, contaiment test using smoke or vapor, face and duct velocity measurement protocols, various ACGIH testing procedures, and hood static pressure.



### Periodic testing programs

Programs for testing LEV system shall include: #parameters 

- Determination of the effectiveness of hte ventilation system
	- emissions capture, particulate transport, employee and product protection, efficiency, air cleaning)
- Establishment of baseline or startup conditions
- Monitoring of conditions throughout the life of the system.
- Compliance while permitting agency requirements and management-determined criteria.
