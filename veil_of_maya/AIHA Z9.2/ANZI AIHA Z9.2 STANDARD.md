Design shall document the dilution ratios for various limits per OH&S best practices

[[ANSI-AIHA Fundamentals Design and Operation-Local exhaust Ventilation Systems.pdf#page=20]]


###  Location of process

Process to be exhaust ventilated by a single LEV system hsould be located close together and arranged, if conditions permit, in order that:

1. The shortest length of duct and minimum number of elbows are used
2. Proper proportoining of air flow from the various hoods is facil.iate

[[ANSI-AIHA Fundamentals Design and Operation-Local exhaust Ventilation Systems.pdf#page=22]]


### Makeup Air #airflow

Provisions should be made for the supply of clean, tempered air into the building to replace air removed by LEV systems.

In mosts cases, makeup iar should be provided by a dedicated mechanical ventilation system. The volume flow rates of make air is often equal to the exhaust volume flowrate. However, in some circumstances a slight negative pressure may be required in an area to control fugitive emissions and/or prevent migration of contaminants to other areas of the plan or building.o

Where possible the makeup air system should be located so as to maintain the following conditions:

1. The supplt air to the space should be located so clean, properly tempered air is first passed over the workers and the to the contaminated area, where it will be removed by LEV system
2. The air flow should provide cross ventilation in the area, thus using this air for effective general ventiolation as well as for makeup
3. The air should flow from the clean areas to contaminated areas 
4. .Avoid high velocities at worker locations to avoid vortives around a worker's body which can create higher exposures. 


Recirculated air from LEV systems is not considered part of the make air system.

Typical filters to protect fans and coils include ASHRA 51.2 ratings of 30-90% and ASHRAE 52.2 MERV ratings of 4-10.

[[ANSI-AIHA Fundamentals Design and Operation-Local exhaust Ventilation Systems.pdf#page=26]]

 ### Exhaust Hoods #exhaust

Typical exhaust criteria is defined by ACGIH as:

"Concentration of emited contaminants iun the workroom air should not routinely exceed of the 10% ACGIH TLV, or the odor threshhold, whicever is less"

Risk assessment procedures should be used in the appraisal of potentially A hazardous failure [[RMP]]

Hood design, operation, and testing shall consider and document the following parameters:
	
* Shape and construction material
* The air flowrate necessary to control emissions and odor migration
* The entry loss factors for hoods, sl.ots and ductsm and/or the Coefficient of Entry
* Velocities(e.g. face velocity, control velocity, slot and plenum velocities, and duct transport velocity);
* Slot dimensions, slolt velocities
*

Hood techincal data is found in the literature source of Appendix A. [[ANSI-AIHA Fundamentals Design and Operation-Local exhaust Ventilation Systems.pdf#page=53]]
Traditional source is the Industrial Ventilation Manual. [[Industrial Ventilation Manual.pdf]]

### Ductwork and Stack #duct

Appropriate materials approved for use by cognizant authorities an others, should be used. Rarely, for example, would a PVC sewer pipe be appropriate

Duct velocities shall be sufficient to prevent the settling of dry aerosols. Where mists, sticky partciles, or condesnisng materials are carrid in the dust, provision for fuct cleaning shall be provided

Velocities of 15- 25 m/s are common. Duct cleaning provisons usually include: drains, sloped ductwork for drains, cleanout openings, water spray cleaning sytems, vacuum cleaning, systems and so forth.


Non-condensable vapors and gases mix intimat3ely with the air and may be moved any convenient velocity. Common practice is such that duct work for a velocity of 6-10 m/s where only gases or vapors are exhausted.


When it is necessay to carry exhaust ducts through fire walls, automatic dampers shall be provided in the exhaust duct in accordance with local and NFPA codes.

Stacks shall locatedc and designed such re-entraiment air is held to a minimum and workers in the vicinity are not exposed to hazar4dous concentrations.	

Round ductwork is preferred due to:

- It resists settling of dry partciles
- it is less expensive; and
- it resists collapsing

Re-entrainment goals include " less than 1 % rez-entrainment  in the sourc eubilding ", or "workers not exposed to more than 10% of OEL"


### Exit Velocity #exhaust 

Provide stack exit v]elocity of at least 3,000 ft/min to avoid backdraft


### Architectural enclosure #roof_exterior

- Do not place air intakes and exhaust stacks in the same enclosure
- Use oen enclosiured ( slatted sides)
- Use high-velocity stacks



###  Air Cleaning Equipment

Air cleaning should be used to meet the following criteria:

- To meet the permit requirements
- To prevent the creation of a hazard or nuisance in the area exposed to the effluent of the LEV system.
- To prevent contmiantion of the plant makeup iar
- To protect fans or other air moving equipment
- Tp permit recirculation of the exhaust air, under certain circumstances, in order to reduce heating and cooling losses.


### Fans and Moving devices
[[ANSI-AIHA Fundamentals Design and Operation-Local exhaust Ventilation Systems.pdf#page=41]]
 
 
 The following information shall be used to determine fan selection
 
 - Air flowrate
 - Fan total pressure and/or fan static pressure;
 - Air temperature, humidity, and density;
 - Aerosol or vapor loading;
 - Type and size of fan;
 - Inlet and outlet duct configurations;
 - Wheel type, construction, and material;
 - Motor size, type, and drive starter wiring;
 - Fan class and physical configuration of the fan housing;
 - Access to fan housing, bearings, seals;
 - Flexible coupling to ductwork;
 - Noise and noise requirements;
 - Rain and weather protection;
 - Stack requirmeents;
 - Fan location

lets build a temp fold and see if that sticks
another curious thing to wonder about

### Fans and Air Moving Devices


Not identifying and correcting for system effect losses may result in reduced flow at the hood.


Exception to the normal rule include manifold exhaust systems desgined for variable inlets where operating on the flat part of the curve may be more advantageous, which generally applied to blow and compressors operating above 20 "  w.c.

### Housing #flammability

The fan wheel, the casing or both can be made of non-sparking material and the motor hsould either be placed outside the combustible region or be of explosion-proof dcesign. In some cases, gas-tight shaft seals and genearl gas-tight construction are required to prevent leaks of gas or a mixture of air. Electrical bodning and grounding should be installed when the system carried materials that can create sparks or fire and bonding interlovks and alarms should be used where appropriate.


### Management of LEV systems

Manager should include:

- Acceptance of a statement and responsibility;
- Identification or assignment of a cognizant or responsible person;
 - Recrodkeeping provisions;
-  Maintenance of up-to-date plans and specifications;
-  Development of emergency plans;
- Provisions for employee training;
- Provisions for ventilation testing and monitoring of LEV systems;
- Provisions for hood use approval mechanismp; and
- Provisions for rules-of-us, stand operating procedures, and work practices.



Optimum work practices should include: 	#operation

- Sashes, door, and enclosure or hood clsured should be placed at the proper position.
- Hoods and exhausted enclosures should be used when the exhaust is on.
- Only approvedmaterials hsoudl be used in teh exhausted enclosure and hood.
- The employee should do only that for whic he/she is trained.
- A worker should not place his or her body in the exhausted enclosure or hood
- Employees should be trained to use propler work practices at the LEV sytem and in the safe effective operfation of the system.	


Positioning of cleanout doors and access opoeningn should comply with SMACNA standarrds of industrial ducts  #duct
