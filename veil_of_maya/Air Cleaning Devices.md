### Selection of Dust Collection equipment

two basic groups: air filters and dust collectors


Cut-off criteria: 1.0 per 1000 cubic feet of air


Selection of the collector is driven by the elimination factor over the efficiency. Alhough general consensus is that effeciency must be improve as the system grows larger.

### Dust Collector Types


The four major types of dust collectors for particulate contaminatns are electrostatic preciptators, fabric collectors, wet collectors, and dry centrifugal collectors.

#### Electrostatic precipitatiors

Electrostatic proces consist of:

1. ionizing the gas
2. Charging the dust particles
3.  Transporting hte particle to the collecting surface
4.  Neutralizing, or removing the charge from the dust particles
5.  Removing the dust from the collecting surface

ionizing voltage are 40k to 70k

### Fabric Collectors

Depending on the amount of partciulate and the time interval betwen fabric reconditoning, it may well be that virtually all filtration is is accomplished by previously collected particles.


Variable design features of collector 

1. Type of fabric (woven vs non-woven)
2.  Fabric configuration (bags or tubes, envelopes, cartridges)
3.  Intermitten or continuous service
4.  Type of reconditioning (shaker, pulse jet, reverse air)
5.  Housing configuration (single compartment, multiple compartment)



Fabric collectors are sized to provide a sufficient area of filter media to allow oepration without excessive presure drop. The amount of filter area required depnds on many factors, including:

1. Release characteristics of dust.
2. Porosity of dust cake.
3. Concentration of dust in carrier gas stream.
4. Type of fabric and surface finsih, if any.
5. Type of reconditioning
6. Reconditioning interval
7. Air flow pattern within the collector.
8. Temperature and humidity of gas stream.

Filtration velocity is the air to cloth ratio for rating fabric collectors. Air to cloth ratio of 7:1 is equivalent to 7 fpm.


#variables #parameters 

Reconditioning must be performed at a specific time inverval (3 to 6 hours interval) and must stopped to reconditon the fabric. Reconditioning usually takes couple minutes.

Rating are usually selected so that the pressure drop accors the fabric will be the 2 - 5" wg range between start and end of operating cycle.

Reconditioning is usually accomplished by shaking or vibrating. When shaking is used for fabric reconditioning, the filtration velicty usually is in the 1-4 fpm range. Reverse-air collapse-type reconditioning generally necessistates lower filtration velocities since reconditioning is not as complete. They are seldom rated higher than 3 fpm.


Reverse-jet ,continuous-duty fabric collector may use envelopes or tube of non-woven fabric.


#### Wet Collectors:

Various designs  1.5" wg << 100"wg

#### Dry centrifugal collectors

Collection efficiency is influence by :

1. Particle size, weight and shape. Performance is improved as size and weight become larger and as the shape becomes more spherical.

2. Collector size and design. The collection of fine dust with a mechanical device requires equpment designed to best utilize mechanical forces and fit specific application needs.

3. Velocity. Pressure drpo through a cyclone collector increases approximately as teh square of the inlet velocity.

4. Dust concentration. Generally , the performance of a mechanical collector increases as the concentration of dust becomes greater.


### Gaseous Contaminant Collectors

1. Adsorbers
2. Director Combustor
3. Thermal oxidizers
4. Catalytic oxidizer

**Absorbers** Adsorbers remove soluble or cheimcally reactive gases from an air stream by contact with a suitable. Most frequently used adsorbent is water with some additives.


**Adsorbers** adsorbers remove contaminants by collection on a solid.  No chemical reaction is used.

**Thermal Oxidizers** Thermal, oxidizer burn combustible contaminants at 1000 -1500 F. The residence chamber must provide sufficient dwell time and turbulence to allow complete oxidation.


**Director Combustors** differ from thermal oxidizers by introducing contaminated gas and auxiliary air diretly into the burner as fuel.

**Catalytic Oxidizers** used when contaminant is combustible. The contaminated gas stream is preheated and then passed through a catalyst bed which promoted oxiddation of the combustible to carbo dioxide and water vapor. Metals, such as platinum, are used as catalyst to promote oxidation temperature between 700 and 900 F

To use CO the combustible contaminant must be below the LEL.
