# Thermodyamics and refrigeration cycles 
#ASHRAE 

[[ASHRAE - Objective 1]]
Potential energy within a stored energy system is typically caused by attractivve forces existing between molecules, or the elevation of the system 

$$PE = mgz$$
m = mass
g = local accelration of gravity
z = elevation above horizontal reference plane

#Law
First law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy, where the amount of energy within the system must saty within the system.

Reference ([Gibbs free energy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy))

#Law 
The second law of thermodyanmics can be describe in terms of entropy 
#equations 
$$ E_i - E_o = dS_system$$

Understanding the coefficient of performance is also important, refrigeration cycles tend to drain the most energy in terms of ulitites.

Carnot cycle is completely reversible. This will never be the case with many cycles wtihin the realm of thermodynamics.
