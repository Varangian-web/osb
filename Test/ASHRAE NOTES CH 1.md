#ASHRAE 

[[ASHRAE - Objective 1]]
Which uses thee thermodynamic propertires to analyze conditions and processe involving moist air.

The temperature and barometric pressure of atomospheric air vary considerably with altitud as well as with local geographic and weather conditions

Between the triple-point and critical-point tmeperatures of water, two states (saturated liquid and saturated vaper) may coexist in equilibrium 

The water vapor saturation pressure is required to determine a number of moist air porperites, principally the saturation humidity ratio.

When moist air is conisdered a mixture of independent perfect gases, ech is assumed to obey the perfect gas equation of state as follows:

The enthalpy of a mixture of perfect gases equals the sum of the individual partial entahlpies of the components. Therefore, the specific enthalpy of mist ari can be written as follows:

Understand how the steady state and transient systems work regarding the HVAC and AHU within the buildings. Knowing mass flow rates, enthalpy of air and the work that the handlers need in order to actually work truly represent issues within the system as a whole.

Adiabatic conditions will typically never show in this model of creation. In the sense that heat gained or loss will occur betweens streams of air. The issue at hand is that the buildings being analyzed are indeed exceeding a comfortable working temperature. Within Galaxy, the reason is most likely the ovens heating up the surrounding areas and the HVAC system not being able to remove enough heat by the LEV 

Moisture condenstion occurs when moist air is cooled to a temperature below its intital dew point.
