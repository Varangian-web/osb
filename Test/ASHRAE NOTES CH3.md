# Fluid Flow 

In Newtonian fluids,  the rate of deformation is directly proportiontal to the shearing stress
In non-Newtonian fludis, the realtionship between the rate of dormation and shear stress is much much much more complicated.
#equations 
$$ mdot = pVA$$
Where:
mdot = mass flow rate 
p = density 
V = average velocity 
A = area of the pipe or duct that the flow is traveling 

Bernoulli equation is a fundamental principle of fulid flow anaylsis. It incorporates the conservation of momentum and energy along a streamline 

Turbelence is involving random perturbations or fluctuations of the velocity and pressure, characterized
